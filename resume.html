<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>I’m a passionate software developer looking for a challenging web development position at a company with a culture of continuous learning, and where software development is central to the company’s core business. I’ve been part of an agile team for the past year and a half and quickly came to value practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous deployment. I’m most proficient with Ruby, JavaScript and HTML/CSS, but I relish learning new languages and technologies.</p>
